# üíé The Open Network (TON) Organization

Welcome to the The Open Network (TON) Developer Tools on GitHub! This organization is dedicated to the development, collaboration, and open-source contributions related to The Open Network blockchain platform.

## About TON
The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized and open Internet platform made up of several components. These include TON Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. TON Blockchain is the core protocol that connects TON‚Äôs underlying infrastructure to form the greater TON Ecosystem.

TON is focused on achieving widespread cross-chain interoperability while operating in a highly scalable, secure framework. It is designed to process millions of transactions per second (TPS) and eventually reach hundreds of millions of users.

TON Blockchain is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or ‚Äúsuper server,‚Äù intended to provide various products and services that contribute to the development of the decentralized vision for the new internet.
